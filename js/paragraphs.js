  "Our environment is nature’s most precious and vital gift, and it needs to be handled with utmost care. It is the natural ecological system where we live, depending on each other for survival. The environment is divided into physical and biological components. The atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere constitute the physical category, and the biological category comprises human beings and other living beings. In simple terms, the environment is defined as the combination and interrelation between all biotic and abiotic components. The ecosystem of our environment needs to be maintained in a proper balance, and if any part of it is disturbed, the whole ecosystem gets affected.",
  "The environment is the natural world around an organism that allows it to survive. The French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround,’ is derived from the English word ‘environment.’ It is made up of living creatures like plants, animals, and human beings. The non-living elements of the environment are air, water, and land. Nature has designed its functioning in such a way that everything is interdependent. Human beings are the most powerful of all the creatures that rely on and make use of the earth’s natural resources. Air is required for the survival of not just humans but also plants and animals. Without air, there will be no life on Earth. Human beings alone are responsible for the degradation of the environment. The atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere are the different layers that make up the environment. Several gases, like oxygen and nitrogen, that are required for life are found in the atmosphere. The hydrosphere is made up of different water bodies like rivers, oceans, seas, etc. The lithosphere is the earth’s outermost layer, which is made up of rock and soil. The biosphere is home to all living beings. The environment is influenced by a variety of elements, some of which are natural and others man-made.",
  "We live in a God-gifted world, but humans are the reason behind the deterioration of the environment. Everything that surrounds us constitutes the environment. The earth is made up of various environments in which all living and non-living things coexist. Nature’s biological, physical and natural forces interact to generate conditions that allow creatures to survive. The environment is a term used to describe such circumstances. A derivative of the word environment is the French word ‘environ,’ which means ‘to surround.’ The environment is made up of all biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) things. Plants, animals, human beings, and insects are examples of biotic components. They are classified as biological environmental components. Every living thing has a predetermined life cycle. The human being, for example, is the most powerful living entity on the planet. To meet his needs, he requires plants and animals. Without these components, the life of human beings will be disordered. The atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere are all examples of abiotic/physical components. The atmosphere is a gaseous layer containing nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. The hydrosphere is made up of all the water bodies, such as rivers and oceans. The lithosphere is the earth’s solid outer shell. It is composed of the crust, covering the earth’s mantle, rocks, and soil. The biosphere, where life exists, is the most essential layer. There are ecosystems in the water, on land, and in the air.",
  "Both living and non-living organisms are dependent on each other to maintain a balanced ecosystem. A disturbance in any of the categories will create chaos in the entire ecosystem and threaten the environment. Just like the growing human population has become a threat to the environment. Global warming is a major threat to the environment. The atmosphere and hydrosphere, on the other hand, are components of the environment that have an impact on the lives of living things. The atmosphere contains gases like oxygen and nitrogen. Every living being is developed according to the characteristics of these components. Aquatic species, for example, are designed to breathe underwater. Aerial animals are designed to live in the air. So even the tiniest change in nature’s subtle balance makes it difficult for living organisms to survive in the environment it is designed to live in.",

  "Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, contributing to the planet’s beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to maintain a healthy life.",

  "Nature is the ultimate source of our living. Both living and non-living things include nature, and everyone is interdependent, which helps maintain the ecosystem. Plants, animals, and humans all depend on nature for their survival. It supplies oxygen, sunlight, soil, water, and other necessary components. But deforestation has been the primary cause of global warming, destroying nature. In addition to exploiting excessive natural resources, other industries pollute the environment with toxic gases and chemicals. It is now essential to reduce biological damage, reuse things, and recycle existing materials to create new ones. People from all over the world should join forces to relieve pressure on the environment and restore its balance. It is now the essential aim to serve nature with utmost care to save our nature from hazards and threats.",
  "Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in today’s ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These disasters, which occur as a result of natural causes, have resulted in significant damage. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air to our health cannot be overstated. Nature has a variety of beneficial effects on our bodies. For recuperation and vacations, people choose natural settings. People prefer to raise their children in the countryside in the United States. Their primary goal is to introduce their children to the benefits of natural beauty.",
  "The sun is the only star in our solar system and is present at the centre of all the planets. All eight planets revolve around the sun. The sun is known as a gaseous ball as it is made up of different gases. It is a massive ball of gases but looks very small from the earth because of its distance. The sun’s diameter is 110 times that of the earth, and the sunlight reaches the earth in 8 minutes and 17 seconds. It is a massive source of heat and light to the earth. Humans, plants, animals, etc., cannot grow without the sun’s rays. Our days cannot start without the sunrise. When it is a cloudy day or a winter morning, we all wait for the sun to come out, but we take a lot of protection to stay away from the sun when it is a hot summer day. Without the sun, the whole world would turn into darkness. It is mainly needed during the winter days. The sun’s rays are needed for humans as it is a rich source of vitamin D, but not all sunrays are essential. A few rays, called ultraviolet rays, are harmful to the environment.",
  "sun is a huge star present at the centre of the solar system, and all eight planets revolve around the sun. It is a huge ball of fire and gases. It is formed of various types of gases like hydrogen, helium, oxygen, etc. The sun gives us heat and light for the environment and the growth of organisms. Humans, plants, animals, etc., cannot grow without the sun’s rays. Plants prepare their food through the process of photosynthesis, and the major component is sunlight. Without sunlight, life is impossible on earth. It provides the world with a tremendous amount of heat and light. Humans, plants, animals, and other living things cannot thrive without the energy of the sun. Our days would not be complete without the sunrise. We all wait for the sun to come out on a gloomy day or a cold winter morning, but we put on a lot of sunscreens to remain out in the sun on hot summer days. The world would be in darkness if the sun did not shine. It is primarily required during the winter months. The sun is 110 times larger than the earth but looks very small from the earth due to the large distance between them both. The sun’s rays help us synthesise vitamin D and are, therefore, very essential for human beings. But not all the rays are crucial; there are some UV rays emitted by the sun that are very harmful to the environment. Therefore the earth is surrounded by the atmosphere to save the earth from harmful UV rays.",
  "sun is the nearest star to our planet; still, the Earth is 4.246 light-years away from the sun. Hydrogen and helium are the main elements of the sun’s composition. The sun is an important energy source for the planet earth. Life on Earth would be impossible without the sun. It provides warmth and stands for purity and valour worldwide. Sun is revered in many cultures and worshipped for prosperity and peace. The sun’s rays are known to be a vital source of Vitamin D, needed for our growth. However, owing to pollution in the atmosphere, the ozone layer of the atmosphere is depleting and allowing the Sun’s UV rays to cause harm to our health. It is important to protect the planet as the sun could also be dangerous when we cannot keep the balance in the atmosphere.",
  "Artificial intelligence (AI) has come into our daily lives through mobile devices and the Internet. Governments and businesses are increasingly making use of AI tools and techniques to solve business problems and improve many business processes, especially online ones. Such developments bring about new realities to social life that may not have been experienced before. This essay on Artificial Intelligence will help students to know the various advantages of using AI and how it has made our lives easier and simpler. Also, in the end, we have described the future scope of AI and the harmful effects of using it. To get a good command of essay writing, students must practise CBSE Essays on different topics.",
  "In the future, intelligent machines will replace or enhance human capabilities in many areas. Artificial intelligence is becoming a popular field in computer science as it has enhanced humans. Application areas of artificial intelligence are having a huge impact on various fields of life to solve complex problems in various areas such as education, engineering, business, medicine, weather forecasting etc. Many labourers’ work can be done by a single machine. But Artificial Intelligence has another aspect: it can be dangerous for us. If we become completely dependent on machines, then it can ruin our life. We will not be able to do any work by ourselves and get lazy. Another disadvantage is that it cannot give a human-like feeling. So machines should be used only where they are actually required.",
  "Trees are very important, valuable and necessary to our existence as they have furnished us with two important life essentials; food and oxygen. Apart from basically keeping us alive, there are many other little and big benefits we get from trees. So, trees are vital resources for the survival of all living beings. Therefore, Governments world over and many Organizations are taking steps to prevent deforestation and to tell the benefits of planting trees. Let us go through some important points about the Importance of trees for the existence of human life.",
  " Trees receive the rainwater and hold them in the land. This prevents clean water from flowing and getting wasted in drains. Along with it they also act as watersheds and hold the floodwaters for some time before slowly releasing them into the earth and atmosphere. So, they maintain the water base of an area and provides us with a water bed. The root system of the trees is so well made by nature that it holds the soil underground from getting washed away during rain and floods thus prevents landslides and soil erosion.",
